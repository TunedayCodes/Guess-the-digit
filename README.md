This is an app that's built to take in inputs in numbers from user with the goal of guessing the right digits programmed in the app.

We have an heading stating the purpose of the game to the user then a paragraph that explains further what the app is all about and the neceesary instructions.

Then an input is added to take in users guess and a button to check if the guess is correct and it return result of the guess with the help of Javascript.

I was able to write a code to generate a random number between 1 and 100 which serves as the picked number to be guessed correctly and its changes a the start of every new game.

I provided the player a way to guess and input what digit they want to if its correct, a congratulatory message will pop and if otherwise a message will tell the player they are wrong.
